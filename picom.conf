# Window type settings
#
# 'WINDOW_TYPE' is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard:
#   "unknown", "desktop", "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility",
#   "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu",
#   "tooltip", "notification", "combo", and "dnd".
#
# Following per window-type options are available: ::
#
#   fade, shadow:::
#   Controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
#
#   opacity:::
#   Controls default opacity of the window type.
#
#   focus:::
#   Controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused.
#   (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)
#
#   full-shadow:::
#   Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you
#   normally won't be able to see. Useful when the window has parts of it
#   transparent, and you want shadows in those areas.
#
#   clip-shadow-above:::
#   Controls whether shadows that would have been drawn above the window should
#   be clipped. Useful for dock windows that should have no shadow painted on top.
#
#   redir-ignore:::
#   Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become
#   redirected again after been unredirected. If you have unredir-if-possible
#   set, and doesn't want certain window to cause unnecessary screen redirection,
#   you can set this to `true`.
